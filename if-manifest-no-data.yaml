params:
  # each of these parameters is a required attribute for each input observation in the manifest
  - name: timestamp
    description: Starting timestamp of observation, on second level, in ISO notation with ISO 8601
                 notation. Please note that the timezone postfix should be included and should be 
                 equal to "Z" (i.e. UTC-timezone). Only UTC-timezone is currently supported; all 
                 output is thus also in UTC-time.
    aggregation: none
    unit: none
  - name: META_UNIQUEID
    description: Unique identifier of server environment that the observation took place on.
    aggregation: none
    unit: none
  - name: grid/carbon-intensity
    description: Carbon intensity at location of server environment at time of timestamp. This needs to be
                 provided as input to the manifest due to performance issues with WattTime (see comment
                 in pipeline)
    aggregation: avg
    unit: gCO2e/kWh
  - name: duration
    description: Duration of observation in seconds. Only value 1 is currently supported by the Power BI report
                 that loads in the output manifest data. For the manifest itself, other values are supported.
    aggregation: sum
    unit: second
  - name: memory/capacity
    description: The total amount of memory available, in GB, at timestamp.
    aggregation: avg
    unit: GB
  - name: cpu/utilization
    description: Proportion (between 0 and 1 as decimal) of total CPU capacity being used at timestamp. 
    aggregation: avg
    unit: proportion
  - name: memory/utilization
    description: Proportion (between 0 and 1 as decimal) of total RAM capacity being used at timestamp. 
    aggregation: avg
    unit: proportion
  - name: cpu/thermal-design-power
    description: Thermal design power of CPU. We provide this as input parameter to the manifest as not all CPUs 
                 are recognized currently by existing plugins.
    aggregation: avg
    unit: watt
  - name: cpu/usage_cycles
    description: Total CPU cycles used at timestamp over duration seconds. 
    aggregation: sum
    unit: cpu_cycle
  - name: memory/usage_GB
    description: Total GB RAM used at timestamp over duration seconds.
